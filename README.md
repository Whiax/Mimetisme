This repository will contain the Part 1/3 of a project which aims to build an Artificial Human-like Intelligence commonly known as AGI.  

Progress report: https://medium.com/p/artificial-early-language-acquisition-from-videos-c216ebac9be8   
The image / sound link is at least partially established. This model will require a more advanced processing of languages and sounds before being finished.
